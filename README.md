Publication Title-
Towards Morbidity Identification Employing Deep Learning and Word Embeddings within Clinical Notes

Abstract-
Today, we are seeing  an ever-increasing number  of clinical notes that contain clinical results, images, and textual descriptions of the patient’s health state. All these data can be analyzed and employed to cater novel services that can help people and domain experts with their com-mon healthcare tasks. However, many technologies such as Deep Learning and tools like Word Embeddings have started to be investigated only recently, and many challenges remain open when it comes to healthcare domain applications. To address these challenges, we propose the use of Deep Learning and Word Embeddings for identifying sixteen morbidity types within  textual descriptions of  clinical records. For this purpose, we have used a Deep Learning model based on Bidirectional Long-ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) layers which can exploit state-of-the-art vector representations of data such as Word Embeddings. We have employed pre-trained  Word  Embeddings namely GloVe and Word2Vec,  and our own Word Embeddings trained on the target domain. Furthermore, we have compared the performances of the deep learning approach against the traditional tf-idf using Support Vector Machine and Multilayer perceptron (our baselines). From the obtained results it seems that the latter outperforms the combination of Deep Learning approaches using any word embeddings. Our preliminary results indicate that there are specific features that make the dataset biased in favor of machine learning approaches.
